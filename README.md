This project is a web tool that aims to enhance the semantic quality of HTML code to promote accessibility and improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Built using a React frontend and Flask backend, it allows users to paste HTML code, load it from a URL, or upload an HTML file, and get a more semantic version of the code along with explanations for each change.
