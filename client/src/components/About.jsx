      <p>
        I created this project because I believe strongly in the importance of
        accessibility in technology. Everyone, regardless of ability, should be
        able to engage with the web in a meaningful way. As someone who relies
        on accessibility features to navigate technology efficiently, I
        understand firsthand how important it is for digital experiences to be
        inclusive.

        This tool can help to improve HTML by making it more semantic, but its
        primary goal is to educate developers and content creators on best
        practices for writing semantic HTML. Proper semantics ensure that
        websites are more accessible, understandable, and easier to use for
        everyone, including those using assistive technologies. As a bonus, it
        helps with search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines
        prioritize well-structured and meaningful content. I hope this project
        encourages people to think more critically about how they structure
        their HTML and inspires more accessible design across the web.
